# Biaxial Fitting Application

General description
Biaxial Fitting Application is an application that can be used:
  1.) to conduct finite element simulation of biaxial tensile experiment on incompressible hyperelastic materials (so called virtual experiments)
  2.) for mechanical characterization from virtual experiments based on standard approach
  3.) for mechanical characterization from virtual experiments based on inverse approach
